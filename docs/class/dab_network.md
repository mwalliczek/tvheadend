## Force Scanning

Force scanning can take some time. You may continue to use Tvheadend 
while a scan is in progress, but doing so will increase the time needed 
for it to complete. Note that the time required can vary depending on a 
number of factors, such as how many tuners you have available and the 
number of muxes on each.
